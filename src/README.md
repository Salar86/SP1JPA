**A description of our business idea**

Our application is designed to connect individuals with similar hobbies and interests. The app is designed to bridge the gap by creating a platform where people can connect and engage with others in the safety and comfort of their own home.

**A group description of your group work and how you have collaborated (GIT, Discord, who did what, etc.)**

•	**Git:** 

We use Git as our version control system to manage the project's source code. Git allows us to track changes, collaborate on code, and maintain different branches for feature development, bug fixes, and releases. We've set up a GitHub repository to host our project.

•	**Google Docs:** 

Google Docs serves as our project management tool. We've created a list where we organize tasks into different lists such as "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Each task includes a description, due date, and assigned team member. This helps us keep track of our progress and stay organized.

•	**Discord:** 

We use Discord as our primary communication platform. We have a dedicated server for our group where we have separate text channels for general discussions, feature planning, bug reporting, and voice channels for team meetings.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

We divided our project into several sections, where each developer contributed to an entity.

•	Micheal: Worked on the address entity.


•	Salar: Worked on the user entity.


•	Mohammad: Worked on the hobby entity.


•	Mayas: Worked on the zip entity.

**Collaboration Workflow:**

•	**Micheal** 

Creates tasks on Google Docs based on the project roadmap and assigns them to the respective team members.

•	Team members use Discord for real-time communication, sharing updates, and discussing any issues or questions that arise during development.

•	Developers commit their code changes to Git, following the branching strategy agreed upon by the team.

•	Team members test the features and report any bugs or issues on Discord. The appropriate team member addresses these issues and updates the document accordingly.

•	Team members engage in regular reviews and conducts team meetings on Discord to ensure everyone is on track and that the project is progressing as planned.

•	This collaborative approach using Git, Google Docs, and Discord helps our team efficiently manage the Hobby development process, stay organized, and maintain clear communication throughout the project's lifecycle.
